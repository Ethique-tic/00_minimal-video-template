    HERE ADD MY TEXT:  Hand-drawn sketching, on napkins or whiteboards, is a common, accessible method for generating visual data representations. This practice is shared by experts and non-experts and is probably one of the faster and more expressive ways to draft a visual representation of the data. In order to better understand the types of and variations in what people produce when sketching data, we conducted a qualitative study. We asked people with varying degrees of visualization expertise, from novices to experts, to manually sketch representations of a small, easily understandable dataset using pencils and paper and to report on what they learned or found interesting about the data. From this study, we extract a data sketching representation continuum from numeracy to abstraction; a data report spectrum from individual data items to speculative data hypothesis; and show the correspondence between the representation types and the data reports from our results set. From these observations we discuss the participantsâ€™ representations in relation to their data reports, indicating implications for design and potentially fruitful directions for research.

      Jagoda is a PhD candidate working with Dr. Sheelagh Carpendale in the Innovis Group (Interactions Lab, Department of Computer Science) at the University of Calgary. I am interested in how everyday visual thinking methods such as sketching can inform information visualizations. I use a qualitative approach to explore the characteristics of analog visual thinking tools.
